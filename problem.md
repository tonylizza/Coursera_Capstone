# Problem Description and Discussion of Background
One of the major contributors to traffic delays are serious car accidents that require transporting of injured and/or clearing of wreckage. The business value we are attempting to provide is to answer the question "What is the best way to predict (and therefore avoid) serious car accidents when driving?" The goal of this exercise is to predict the severity of a given road collision when provided with certain details regarding the accident (e.g., weather and the road conditions) to allow drivers to drive more carefully or modify their travel plans in response to avoid encountering accidents.
